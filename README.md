# ArcGIS Location Platform: An Introduction for Developers

ArcGIS Location Platform is a geospatial platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for developers that need to integrate location capabilities into their apps, business systems, and products. It also allows developers to create apps and extend ArcGIS products using ArcGIS APIs and SDKs. In this session, we will go through what's new and what's different between ArcGIS Platform and ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise when developing apps and how your organization might benefit from it.
